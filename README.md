LCA-I contains work done for the LCA I assignment and contains none of the modifications specified for assignment LCA II for the sake of clarity when grading LCA I assignment.

All the LCA II modifications are in the LCA II folder which contained a direct copy of LCA-I folder as of time of my submission of LCA I to BlackBoard.
